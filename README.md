Data Reduction and Phase-I Analysis of a Manufacturing Process

• Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in MATLAB to reduce data dimension to few key variables.

• Conducted multivariate analysis through six-sigma techniques to acquire In-Control parameters.

• Implemented various  techniques such as m-Cusum and Hotelling T2 to improve detection rate.

The project is based on a set of data collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data are present. A method is developed to identify the data falling in the respective categories, i.e., which ones are in-control and which ones out of control. This is amounted to a Phase I analysis, whose purpose to isolate the in-control data for estimating the in-control distribution parameters so that a monitoring scheme can be set up for future missions.
